# SimpleModpackInstaller

This tool is used to simplify the installation process of Minecraft Modpacks published as a Git repository.

It can also be used to organise the use of multiple modpacks with the default Minecraft launcher by offering the option of creating a custom profile per modpack. It allows you to keep different modspack in their own folders. You can specify during the installation process if you want to copy your resourcepacks, settings and shaderpacks to this new profile. The profile will be automatically added to your launcher and pre-configured to use the modpack folder and the best amount of RAM for your specs

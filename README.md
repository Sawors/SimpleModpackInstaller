### Directory per Modpack
Each time you install a Modpack using the SimpleModpackInstaller, 
a new directory is created in .minecraft/profiles/ with the modpack name : *.minecraft/profiles/MODPACKNAME/*.
If the directory already exists, a new one is created with MODPACKNAME_1 or bigger number for each copy.
